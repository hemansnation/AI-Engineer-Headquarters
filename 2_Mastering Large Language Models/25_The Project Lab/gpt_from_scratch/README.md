1. read the brief about the book: Building LLM from Scratch
2. upload this book in NotbookLM by Google
3. ask this question: "can you give me a brief about all the steps I need to take to build LLMs from scratch?"
   
5. go to chatGPT to create a prompt for building the project
   
create a prompt for me which will explain the llm to build LLM from scratch, in 3 stages on by one,
building the project that can work on VS code, anaconda environment, mac m1 CPU, using small sample of fineweb dataset.

here are the information about those 3 stages:
Building a Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch involves a three-main-stage process
6. use those 3 stages of prompts and put them in Grok one by one. (check those steps here: https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_576d166e-264d-41ef-a50d-eacf9d953c60)
7. use the steps to build your project in VS code.

8. stage 2 and stage 3


# steps to run

1. scipts/train.py



# Assignment
1. complete the project
2. create a flow diagram of building LLM
3. integrate a front end to display the flow of building LLM
4. create  repo on your github and push the code there
5. post a simple demo on linkedin
